    <p>A few weeks ago, I shared about how I wanted to write a better pastebin/pastebucket, one that was beautiful, easy to use, and suitable for text. I pretty quickly mocked one up in NodeJS, and I even had it pseudo-deployed on a server owned by a friend.</p>
<p>Now, I'd never used NodeJS before, and, perhaps I'm really dumb, but I'm having trouble moving beyond the most basic example code. Sure, there are really awesome things with the package management and the libraries seem robust. However, I kept getting stuck at different points.</p>
<p>So, I succumbed to my dumbness and left it on the shelf for a little while. Today, I started taking a free course from <a href="http://www.10gen.com">10Gen</a> on MongoDB. In it, they write most of their examples in Python. Now, I don't have much more experience with Python than I do with server-side JS. I've read most of <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> and I've written a single useful script in Python. (As a side note: that one script saved me from writing in VBScript, so I can hardly express my gratitude for the simplicity of Python and the excellent <a href="http://packages.python.org/openpyxl/">OpenPyXL libraryy</a>). However, despite my newbie status with regards to Python, I was struck again by how intuitive this language is.</p>
<p>So, out the window goes my fledgling NodeJS code. In comes a new version drafted in Python. The original code wasn't even 200 lines long. It's a little silly to even write a post about the switch, but I'll probably look back at it as a touch stone. Peer pressure had a little to do with this. I have a bunch of friends who write in Python and they, plus the things they work on, are pretty cool.</p>
