I have been inspired… and that led me here.

I bought this domain a few months ago. I knew I needed a little corner of the net to call my own: a place to write a thought or two or share a cool hack. I aspire to create/contribute to more open source projects, and whenever that happens I’ll need space to discuss it. Still, I sat on the domain–too lethargic to even click the “configure wordpress” button.

Yesterday, I attended the [59 Days of Code](http://59daysofcode.com/). “Damn,” I thought, “there’s a ton of ideas and energy out there. I better get going.”

Here we are. Stay posted.
