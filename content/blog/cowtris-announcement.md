Author: Ben Jacobs

I am very happy to announce an initial release of [Cowtris: a falling block
game with cows][cowtris]. This is actually version three of Cowtris. The first
two versions were written by [David Glick][davisagli] between 10 and 13 years
ago and ran on Windows. I'm trying to bring it into 2013 with a version that
runs natively in your web browser.

Cowtris was originally released by *Nonsense Software*, aka the greatest-
defunct-software-company-ever. Nonsense Software deserves several blog posts
all of its own. For now, all you need to know is that once there were four
boys who grew up in or around Goshen, Indiana, who dabbled in the following:
computer programming, bicycling, building tree forts, building pirate rafts,
building trebuchets, and writing short stories about a paper clip with super
powers. They had lots of "incredible" ideas for computer games we were going
to write, but Cowtris was the only one that materialized. 

My role in the original game included (hours and hours) of "quality assurance
testing" and composing a few truly awful midi tunes for the soundtrack.

Now, the glory of Cowtris returns to the world wide web. You can play at
[http://blog.benbybenjacobs.com/cowtris][cowtris]. Keep in mind, this is an
early release, and there are bound to be issues. If you find any bugs, or you
want to request a new feature, please send me an [email][email] or file an
issue on the [Cowtris Github Page][gh]. If you're a developer, Cowtris is open
source and under the terms of the GPL. I welcome any submissions to the source
code.

I'll leave you with some text from the original readme for the game which I
think is great:

> Okay, I guess tetris games are almost as plentiful as AOL CD's and telemarketer calls, so why do you need a new one? Well, Cowtris may not differ from those other games in many aspects, but there is one: Mighty few of the others feature our bovine friends.

> Well, maybe that's not a very compelling reason, but all the same we hope that you'll enjoy Cowtris and spend many happy hours in blissful bovinedom. If you do enjoy it, please take the time to tell your friends and to let us know what you think.
