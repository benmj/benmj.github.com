Title: LapTimer Posted to GitHub

I've been hacking around with computers for over a decade, and have always loved the idea of the open source movement. I was running Debian Linux on my personal computer back in sixth grade. (This had its ups and downs, and I still dual booted so I could play StarCraft). Despite my hero worship for ESR, RMS, LT and the rest--I could never think of something to contribute.

The other day I posted my [LapTimer](reusable-laptimer-for-ios.html), which I wrote because I *needed it for a project*. This is probably how a lot of great open source projects come about. You need something. You create something. You give that thing up to the world.

In the spirit of Open Source, I've created a spot for [LapTimer on GitHub](https://github.com/benmj/LapTimer). I'll have to trust everyone who says that no project is too small to share.

Happy Hacking! Also, thanks to [@scharton](https://twitter.com/scharton) for inspiring me.
